Evolution of .NET Core
1. Initial Release (2016): .NET Core 1.0

Key Features: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux), modular framework, open-source.
2. .NET Core 2.0 (2017):

Key Features: Improved compatibility with .NET Framework, expanded API surface, easier migration from .NET Framework.
3. .NET Core 3.0/3.1 (2019):

Key Features: Support for Windows desktop applications (WinForms, WPF), long-term support (LTS) for 3.1, Blazor for web development.
4. .NET 5 (2020):

Key Features: Unified platform (merging .NET Core and .NET Framework), C# 9, performance improvements, ARM64 support.
5. .NET 6 (2021):

Key Features: Long-term support (LTS), .NET MAUI (multi-platform app UI), minimal APIs, Hot Reload.
6. .NET 7 (2022):

Key Features: Performance enhancements, .NET MAUI improvements, Cloud-native support.
7. .NET 8 (2024):

Key Features: Enhanced performance, ASP.NET Core updates, Entity Framework Core enhancements, .NET MAUI improvements, C# 12​ (Microsoft Developer Blogs)​​ (Microsoft Learn)​​ (Microsoft)​.
Main Advantages
Cross-Platform Support:

Develop and run applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Performance:

High performance and scalability, with continuous improvements in runtime and garbage collection.
Unified Platform:

A single platform for all types of applications (web, mobile, desktop, cloud, microservices).
Open Source:

Community-driven development, transparency, and collaboration via GitHub.
Modularity:

Ability to include only the necessary components, reducing the application's footprint.
Advanced Tools and Features:

Integrated with Visual Studio, strong support for modern development practices (CI/CD, containerization).
Main Disadvantages
Learning Curve:

Transitioning from .NET Framework to .NET Core can be challenging for developers familiar with the older framework.
API Gaps:

Some APIs and features available in the .NET Framework may not be present or behave differently in .NET Core.
Ecosystem Maturity:

While improving, some third-party libraries and tools might lag in support or compatibility with the latest .NET versions.
Platform-Specific Limitations:

Certain features may work better or only be available on specific platforms (e.g., Windows-specific features).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The .NET CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and managing .NET applications. It provides commands to perform various tasks, such as creating new projects, restoring dependencies, building projects, and running applications.

Most Used Commands
dotnet new

Usage: Creates a new .NET project or file from a template.
Example: dotnet new console - Creates a new console application.
dotnet restore

Usage: Restores the dependencies and tools specified in a .NET project.
Example: dotnet restore - Restores the dependencies for the project in the current directory.
dotnet build

Usage: Builds a .NET project and its dependencies.
Example: dotnet build - Compiles the project and all of its dependencies.
dotnet run

Usage: Runs the application from the source code.
Example: dotnet run - Builds and runs the application.
dotnet publish

Usage: Publishes the application and its dependencies to a folder for deployment.
Example: dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish - Publishes the application in Release configuration to the ./publish folder.
dotnet test

Usage: Runs unit tests using a test runner specified in the project.
Example: dotnet test - Runs tests in the project.
dotnet add

Usage: Adds a package or reference to the project.
Example: dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json - Adds the Newtonsoft.Json package to the project.
dotnet remove

Usage: Removes a package or reference from the project.
Example: dotnet remove package Newtonsoft.Json - Removes the Newtonsoft.Json package from the project.
dotnet clean

Usage: Cleans the output of the previous build.
Example: dotnet clean - Cleans the build outputs of the project.
dotnet sln

Usage: Manages solution (.sln) files.
Example: dotnet sln add MyProject.csproj - Adds a project to the solution.
